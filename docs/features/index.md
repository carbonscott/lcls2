# Features

Each page describes one part of lcls2: what it is, the main concepts and
classes, a minimal example, and where the code lives. Everything on these pages
was checked against the source in this repository; file paths are relative to
the repository root. Where something could not be verified it says so.

Most examples need LCLS data. Some use the small xtc2 files that ship with the
tests (`psana/psana/tests/test_data/`, `psana/psana/tests/*.xtc2`); the others
need access to LCLS data storage, the calibration database, or a running DAQ.
