# psana.event

`Event` is the object yielded by `run.events()` and `step.events()`. It holds
the dgrams of one event (one per stream; missing ones are `None`) and gives
access to the event's `timestamp` (64-bit: seconds in the upper 32 bits,
nanoseconds in the lower 32 bits), `datetime()`, `service()` (transition id)
and `run()`, which returns a small `RunCtx` (`psana/psana/psexp/run_ctx.py`),
not the full `Run`. Detector data are read through detector objects
(`det.raw.calib(evt)`), not from the event directly.

See [DataSource, Run and the event loop](../../features/datasource-run-events.md).
